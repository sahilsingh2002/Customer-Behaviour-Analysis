The following is a Machine Learning Model of [Consumer behaviour Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads).

# Problem Statement
A company wants to find out whether their old or new customer is interested in buying a car. We have to predict the possibility from the dataset given.

#  What is Consumer Analysis?
According to **medium.com**, Customer analytics is critical for gaining a thorough understanding of customers’ purchasing habits, use trends, demographic distribution, and profitability. Organizations must devote a significant amount of time and resources to learning about their consumers and analyzing the data created by their interactions with them.

## How can Behaviour analysis be carried out?
* On a small scale or where the data is very less, this can be done manually by understanding the data.

* Wherein, cases, where the customer’s dataset is huge and it is almost impossible to look for individual rows manually and find some patterns from data, Machine Learning comes to the rescue!

* There are several built-in algorithms and models available in Machine Learning, making the analysis procedure at peak of easy.

* There are various frameworks designed and used by data scientists to carry out this analysis. One of the frameworks is, STP(Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning.)
